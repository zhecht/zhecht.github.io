<p>In the news, you can find numerous articles with titles similar to the likes of <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2016/quantum-computer-end-encryption-schemes-0303">The beginning of the end for encryption schemes?</a>. This is somewhat counter-intuitive though. Numerous algorithms used in the real-world will become obselete once quantum computers are introduced into our lifes. On the other hand, over enough time, a plethora of new encryption schemes will be created. So the problem we face today...do we have enough time to prepare for the inevitable.</p>

<p>Michele Mosca proposed a simple theorem with huge implications. He defines <code>x</code> as the time (in years) it will take for encryption to become secure, <code>y</code> is how long it will take to re-tool existing infrastructures with quantum safe solutions, and lastly <code>z</code>, how long it will take until a large-scale quantum computer is built.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">If <code>x + y > z</code>, worry.</p>

<p>NIST and other experts expect that a quantum computer will be built within <strong>15 years</strong>. Many security companies and intelligent angencies are well on their way to implementing post-quantum standards. These are schemes that, in theory, are unbreakable even with the use of a quantum computer.</p>

<p>All public key crypto (RSA, DSA, Diffie-Hellman exchange) will be vulnerable to attacks. Symmetric key cryptography (AES) and Hash functions (SHA-1,2,3) would need a modification that can affect runtime and memory. Symmetric key crypto would need larger keys and hash functions would need longer outputs. Public key cryptography together with quantum-resitant algorithms can fix our problem. </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Secret-Key Crypto (AES)</li>
    <li>Multivariate-quadratic equations</li>
    <li>Lattice-Based (NTRU)</li>
    <li>Code-Based (McEliece)</li>
    <li>Hash-Based (Merkle's Tree)</li>
  </ul>
  In theory, these algorithms are thought to be safe from an adversary equipped with a quantum computer. The reason public key cryptography works in practice is due to three properties. 1) Integer Factorization Problem, 2) Discrete Log Problem, 3) Elliptic-Curve Discrete Log Problem. Scientists have shown that with the help of a quantum computer, all these problems can be easily solved in feasible time. Peter Shor introduced the Shor algorithm in 1994, shocking the world of computer science.

<p>The Shor algorithm factors large integers in polynomial time, thus making RSA insecure. The fastest known scheme to break RSA at the time was called the number-field sieve. The number-field sieve, presented in 1988, still has a runtime similar to algorithms presented today. It can factor any RSA % n using 2<sup>(1.9...+o(1))(lg n)^(1/3) (lg lg n)^(2/3)</sup> operations. 6 years later and Shor presented that a quantum computer of size (lg n)<sup>1+o(1)</sup> can factor RSA % n in only (lg n)<sup>2+o(1)</sup> operations.</p>
