<a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Short Answer? No Way</h3>

<p>In the news, you can find numerous articles with titles similar to the likes of <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2016/quantum-computer-end-encryption-schemes-0303">The beginning of the end for encryption schemes?</a>. This is somewhat counter-intuitive though. Numerous algorithms used in the real-world will become obselete once quantum computers are introduced into our lifes. On the other hand, over enough time, a plethora of new encryption schemes will be created. So the problem we face today...do we have enough time to prepare for the inevitable.</p>

<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Mosca Theorem</h3>

<p>Michele Mosca proposed a simple theorem with huge implications. He defines <code>x</code> as the time (in years) it will take for encryption to become secure, <code>y</code> is how long it will take to re-tool existing infrastructures with quantum safe solutions, and lastly <code>z</code>, how long it will take until a large-scale quantum computer is built.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">If <code>x + y > z</code>, worry.</p>

<p>NIST and other experts expect that a quantum computer will be built within <strong>15 years</strong> <span class="cit">[1]</span>. Some scientists even believe we are already at the point where <code>y > z</code> <span class="cit">[2]</span>. If this is the case, then we are already too late. Many security companies and intelligent angencies are well on their way to implementing post-quantum standards. These are schemes that, in theory, are unbreakable even with the access of a quantum computer.</p>

<a id="creating-pages-manually" class="anchor" href="#creating-pages-manually" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Time For A Change</h3>

<p>All public key crypto (RSA, DSA, Diffie-Hellman exchange) will be vulnerable to attacks. Symmetric key cryptography (AES) and Hash functions (SHA-1,2,3) would need a modification that can affect runtime and memory. Symmetric key crypto would need larger keys and hash functions would need longer outputs. Public key cryptography together with quantum-resitant algorithms can also fix this problem. </p>

<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Quantum-Resistant Algorithms</h3>

<p>
  <ul>
    <li>Secret-Key Crypto (AES)</li>
    <li>Multivariate-quadratic equations</li>
    <li>Lattice-Based (NTRU)</li>
    <li>Code-Based (McEliece)</li>
    <li>Hash-Based (Merkle's Tree)</li>
  </ul>
  In theory, these algorithms are thought to be safe from an adversary equipped with a quantum computer. The reason public key cryptography works in practice is due to three properties. 1) The Integer Factorization Problem, 2) The Discrete Log Problem, and 3) The Elliptic-Curve Discrete Log Problem. Scientists have shown that with the assistance of a quantum computer, all these problems can be managed in feasible time. Peter Shor introduced the Shor algorithm in 1994, shocking the world of quantum computing.

<a id="support-or-contact" class="anchor" href="#support-or-contact" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Shor's Algorithm</h3>

<p>The Shor algorithm can factor large integers in polynomial time, thus making RSA insecure. The fastest known scheme to break RSA at the time is called the number-field sieve. The number-field sieve, presented in 1988, still has a runtime similar to factorization algorithms presented today. It can factor any RSA % N using 2<sup>(1.9...+o(1))(lg N)<sup>(1/3)</sup> (lg lg N)<sup>(2/3)</sup></sup> operations. 6 years later and Shor presented that a quantum computer of size (lg N)<sup>1+o(1)</sup> can factor RSA % N in only (lg N)<sup>2+o(1)</sup> operations.</p>

<p>Before we get into an example of how Shor's works, we need to clear up some layman quantum terms for the beginners (like me).</p>

<a id="support-or-contact" class="anchor" href="#support-or-contact" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Definitions</h3>

<p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quantum Bit (Qubit):</strong> Like a bit, a qubit holds information. According to the no-cloning theorem and no-deleting theorem, a qubit's information cannot be copied nor destroyed. A qubit can exist not only in 0 and 1 states (like a bit), but also any combination of the two. <sup>**</sup>CAVEAT: Once the system is observed, the qubit's state collapses into one of its basis states (0,1)<sup>**</sup></li>

<li><strong>Quantum Superposition:</strong> Two quantum states can be added together to create another valid quantum state. <sup>**</sup>Every quantum state can be represented as a sum of two or more other distinct states<sup>**</sup></li>

<li><strong>Quantum Parallelism:</strong> A register of n qubits will have 2<sup>n</sup> basis states of its own. Since a register can exist in a superposition of all these states at once, it is possible to apply a computation to all 2<sup>n</sup> register states rather than just one</li>

<li><strong>Modular Period:</strong> How often a modular set repeats. Say set = {2,4,8,16,32,64,..} ; set (mod 15) = {2,4,8,1,2,4,8,1,..} ; The period would be 4</li>

<li><strong>Shor's Period Finding Algorithm:</strong>
  <br> 
  <span class="indent">
  1) Create superposition of states by applying Hadamard Gates to all qubits in the input register<br>
  2) Implement f as a quantum transform. Shor used repeated squaring<br>
  3) Perform Quantum Fourier Transform
  </span>

</ul>

<h3>
  <a id="support-or-contact" class="anchor" href="#support-or-contact" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Shor's Pseudocode</h3>

<p>
The algorithm consists of two steps.<br>
<span class="indent">
a) Turns the factoring into the period finding problem <br>
b) Finds period using quantum fourier transform 
</span>
<br><br><br>

Factoring a large odd integer N<br>
<span class="indent">
1) Choose random m &lt; N. Compute gcd(m,N) using Euclideans which runs in poly-time. If gcd(m,N) &ne; 1, we have found a non-trivial factor and are finished. <br>
2) Use quantum computer to determine unknown period P with probability close to 1<br>
3) If P is odd, return to step 1 ; Else, proceed. The Pr[P is odd] = (1/2)<sup>k</sup>, where k is the number of distinct prime factors of N.<br>
4) Note: (m<sup>P/2</sup> - 1)(m<sup>P/2</sup> + 1) = m<sup>P</sup> - 1 <br>
If m<sup>P/2</sup> + 1 &equiv; 0 (mod N), return to step 1 ; Else, Proceed. Pr[m<sup>P/2</sup> + 1 &equiv; 0 (mod N)] &lt; (1/2)<sup>k-1</sup> <br>
5) Compute d = gcd(m<sup>P/2</sup> - 1, N) with Euclidean. Since m<sup>P/2</sup> + 1 &ne; 0 (mod N), it is shown that d is non-trivial factor of N.

  <a id="support-or-contact" class="anchor" href="#support-or-contact" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Time to Break RSA</h3>

<p>
Let's start easy with N = 21 (p = 3, q = 7)<br>

1) Random m = 4. gcd(21,4) = 1. Proceed. <br>
2) Find Period of function f..f(a) = 4<sup>a</sup> mod 21. P = 3 <br>
3) P is odd, return to step 1 <br><br>

1) m = 5. gcd(21,5) = 1. Proceed. <br>
2) Find P = 6. <br>
3) P is even. Proceed. <br>
4) 5<sup>3</sup> + 1 &equiv; 0 (mod 21)? Yes, return to 1.<br><br>

1) m = 8. (gcd(21,6) and gcd(21,7) are not 1). gcd(21,8) = 1. Proceed. <br>
2) Q-Computer finds P = 2 with high probability <br>
3) P is even. Proceed. <br>
4) 8<sup>1</sup> + 1 &equiv; 0 (mod 21)? No. Proceed. <br>
5) d = gcd(8<sup>1</sup> - 1, 21) = 7

</p>

<p>
All of these steps can be coded classically, except for 2. This means that in theory, most of the implementation of Shor's can be written today. Our problem comes with finding the period of the function in a feasible amount of time. Shor himself has stated that we won't know the full implications of a quantum computer until one is actually built. Coming full circle, we see why The Mosca Theorem has huge consequences. We need to be able to write quantum-resistant algorithms <i>and</i> implement them into existing infrastructures by the time quantum computers are built.

  <a id="support-or-contact" class="anchor" href="#support-or-contact" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Final Project Hurdles</h3>

<p>
  At the start of this project, I wanted to learn about something completely new to me and the computing world. I invested a lot of time learning new math and reduction concepts because I came into this project with no quantum physics or computing knowledge. I wanted to understand why quantum technology is such a popular topic in the world of cryptography. Turns out, it will be one of the most important challanges we face as computer scientists. 
</p>

<h3>
  <a id="support-or-contact" class="anchor" href="#support-or-contact" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What I've Learned</h3>

<p>
  For one, quantum computing is a highly debated topic in the community. Take the company D-Wave for example. They were the first company to launch the universal quantum computer. D-Wave has partnered with NASA, Google, and countless others in order to push quantum technology into the marketplace. Their computers use quantum annealing, which is basically a way to measure quantum fluctuations for experiments and tests. They based the prototypes off of the papers written by renowned scientist Umesh Vazirani.
</p>
<p>
  In 2007, D-Wave claimed to have an operational 28-qubit quantum annealing computer, and next year claimed to have built a 128-qubit computer. Both of these claims have yet to be verified though. Then in 2015, D-Wave said they have created the first 1000+-qubit computer.
</p>
<p>
  Now here is where things get interesting. Umesh Vazirani, the scientist whose papers are the basis for the D-Wave prototypes, actually rejects the notion that D-Wave built a <i>quantum</i> computer. His beliefs stem from the fact that quantum entanglement is completely absent from D-Wave technology. He's not alone in his opinion either.
